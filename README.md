![Screenshot from 2021-09-02 12-32-07](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64914462/131820361-d7c56304-065a-443a-b94f-f4d6c8e92933.png)

The Bookstore is a website similar to the "Awesome Books" website built in the previous module. Here, I created an MVP version of the 'Awesome Books' website that allows users to:

- Display a list of books.
- Add a book.
- Remove a selected book.

The aim of this project is to:
- Learn how to use React and Redux.
- Understand the concept of state management.
- Use store, actions and reducers in React.
- Connect React and Redux.
